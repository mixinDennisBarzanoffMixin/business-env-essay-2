abstract = {This paper aims to study the effect of using information technology on the quality of the accounting information by studying the dimensions of information technology (collecting, processing, storing, and sending data, and information) with a field study on the Nile Bank in Sudan. The researchers followed some descriptive analytical approach to conduct the field study. Researchers distributed (120) questionnaires and (104) of them were collected. The study concluded that dimensions of information technology (collecting, processing, storing, and transmitting data, and information) impact the dimensions of accounting information quality (relevance, reliability, understandability, consistency, comparability).},

abstract = {The role of chartered accountants in commerce has radically changed over the last decade. Regrettably, tertiary accounting education has not been able to keep up with these changes, resulting in a gap between the skills taught by universities and the skills required by commerce. To reduce this gap, SAICA issued the Competency Framework in 2010 which requires, in addition to the technical knowledge that chartered accountants are best known for, pervasive skills that all chartered accountants should possess upon entering the profession. However, the integration of these pervasive skills with the technical core subjects taught to accountancy students is limited. This article investigated whether one of the listed pervasive skills (namely competency in information and information technology) can successfully be integrated with a technical core subject (namely financial accounting) in such a way that the technical knowledge of the student is improved due to the integration. A Microsoft Excel consolidation model was created and presented to students to complete. Formal assessments and a questionnaire were used to determine whether the completion of the Microsoft Excel consolidation model, affected students' performance. The results showed that the completion of the consolidation model improved students' understanding of financial accounting.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT In this paper, we evaluate the current ability of the accounting function to accommodate the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the organization. This topic has been widely discussed in the past with no substantive collective outcomes on the organization level across companies. In this paper, we revisit this controversial topic and provide a more substantive example for the introduction of AI into the financial accounting function of organizations in general. That is, we provide specific accounting tasks or recordings that can be delegated to AI. This could be used as a model for companies to form and structure their systems to accommodate AI as a starting point in their organizations.},

abstract = {One of the fast-growing fields of technology expansion is communication technologies. The attention is often focused on the social and cultural effects of these expansions; however, the economic implications of the fast-growing digital technologies can be substantial. This paper is an empirical investigation to find a relationship between digital technology expansion and ICT developments on one major economic issue: unemployment. In this way, three indexes of technology (ICT Development Index, The Digital Index, and Technological Readiness) were chosen according to their focus on digital and ICT indicators, and also their sufficient number of observations to provide a global view. The data consists of 163 countries and is structured in a cross-sectional form including observations of the year 2016. Then, the data were subject to an empirical investigation following OLS and GLS estimation methods, along with stability tests. The results show a significant polynomial degree 2 relationship between unemployment and digital technology indexes. The empirical methodology indicates that the relationship is positive in degree 1 and negative in degree 2 coefficients, so it can be concluded that: as digital technologies are expanding, unemployment grows to a maximum and then begins to decline as technology expansion exceeds a specific value.
•Unemployment and digital technology have a saddle-shaped cross-sectional relationship.•Unemployment increases as digital development is at its first steps –as it is in several countries- and after reaching a maximum begins to decline.•Developed countries should beware of thier technolgy stage to prevent unemployment while they are expanding digital technology.},
